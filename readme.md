# Ektogamat Three Graces Design Concept using threejs
<!-- <h4>by Anderson Mancini</h4> -->

This is a Static WebPage of The Three Graces using three.js. The original design was created by Tom Bogner @dastom on Dribble: https://dribbble.com/shots/6767548-The-Three-Graces-Concept.

This project uses Threejs in vanillaJS with WebPack and is based on Anderson Mancini's boilerplate: https://github.com/ektogamat/threejs-andy-bolierplate. I think this could be easier to understand for those who isn't familiar with React Three Fiber yet (like myself).

# Notes
Would be really appreciated if you are willing to give me a star here on GitHub ðŸŽ‰ or buy me a coffee â˜• https://www.buymeacoffee.com/debaditya07. The money will be used to produce more content about threejs or to buy new courses.
